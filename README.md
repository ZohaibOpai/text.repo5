- Linked a CSS stylesheet to style the content  
- Applied different CSS properties like colors, fonts, margins, padding, and alignment  
- Organized the code so that it looks clean and easy to understand  

### 🔹 What I Learned:  
- ✅ How to properly connect **HTML and CSS** files  
- ✅ The importance of indentation and writing **clean, readable code**  
- ✅ How to use CSS for **designing layouts and styling content**  
- ✅ That **practice projects** are small, but very powerful for learning  

### 🔹 Why It Matters:  
This project is my fifth step in web development.  
It shows my progress, discipline, and consistency as a student of coding.  
Small projects like this are building the base for **responsive websites, JavaScript features, and advanced projects** in the future.
